1. Mix together a solution consisting of 100mL concentrated HCl and 100mL 3% (or more) H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>

2. In a large flask with stirring, mix together 100g crushed ore and A-P mix (Step 1) as well as enough distilled water to ensure stirring goes smoothly

3. Ensure the flask is capped off with a peroxide scrubber to neutralize H<sub>2</sub>S fumes

4. Turn on strong stirring and leave to leach for 2-3 days or until fully reacted
	*Note that if allowing to leach for days, a bubbler may be better than leaving stirring on*

5. Turn off stirring and allow sediment to settle overnight

6. Decant the supernatant containing CuCl<sub>2(aq)</sub> and FeCl<sub>2(aq)</sub> into a large beaker

7. Rinse remaining sediment in the flask with distilled water multiple times and transfer water into the beaker as well

8. Steps 6 & 7 were combined and filtered again into another beaker to remove as much suspended dust as possible

9. Submerge the beaker containing the filtered solution in an ice bath

10. Slowly add pieces of aluminum foil. Allow each piece to react completely and let the solution cool again before adding additional pieces

11. Repeat step 8 until no further reaction is observed upon the addition of more foil

12. Allow solid metal precipitates to settle before decanting the AlCl<sub>3</sub>-containing supernatant to be discarded as waste

13. Filter and wash the resulting metal before allowing it to dry

14. Melt metal powder into a bead via blowtorch (optional)
