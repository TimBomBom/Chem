# Chemicals Involved

## - H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (96%)
[SDS](https://www.fishersci.com/store/msds?partNumber=S25597&productDescription=sulfuric-acid-conc-m&vendorId=VN00115888&keyword=true&countryCode=US&language=en)

* Sulfuric acid is the choice acid for dissolving the ore into sulfates. For more info, see [[Research Notes - Procedure#Choice of Acid|Research Notes - Procedure > Choice of Acid]] on why sulfuric acid is the best option.
* Have a plan for spills both on yourself and surroundings. Turn off appliances and get to safety, then try to clean up. If hot acid is spilled, **<u>run</u>**.
* Have a way to wash eyes/body nearby

> [!caution] 
> Concentrated sulfuric acid is very dangerous. Wear gloves, goggles, and lab coat when handling.
> 
> *Remember to add acid to water, NOT water to acid!* 




## - H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (3%)
[SDS](https://www.fishersci.com/store/msds?partNumber=H312500&productDescription=HYDROGEN+PEROXIDE+3%25+USP+500ML&vendorId=VN00033897&countryCode=US&language=en)

* Hydrogen Peroxide is used as an oxidizer in the dissolution of the metals from the chalcopyrite as Copper is a noble metal and does not react with acid (readily).

```ad-note
Hydrogen Peroxide in low concentrations is of little concern and is not classified as a hazard.

# Products

## - H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>(g)</sub>
[SDS](https://www.airgas.com/msds/001029.pdf) 

![[Pasted image 20250322164545.png|100]] ![[Pasted image 20250319191034.png|455]]

* H<sub>2</sub>S is evolved upon combination of chalcopyrite with acid since it is a sulfide ore. The sulfur from the ore reacts with the hydrogen from the acid and evolves as hydrogen sulfide gas.


>[!danger]
>Warning! H<sub>2</sub>S is extremely toxic. Perform any reactions involving or producing H<sub>2</sub>S outside. Bubble fumes through H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/NaOH/NaClO scrubber and always wear a respirator.


>[!danger] 
>H<sub>2</sub>S is extremely flammable, and mixtures of H<sub>2</sub>S with air may be <u>explosive</u>! The air being bubbled into the chamber for aeration may pose an explosion risk. Keep the apparatus away from open flames and be mindful of static discharges.


## - CuSO<sub>4</sub>

> [!Warning]
>Copper (II) Sulfate is acutely toxic to aquatic life (and you) with severe and lasting effects on the former. Do not pour down the drain. Follow [[Waste Management#- CuSO<sub>4</sub>|Waste Management > CuSO4]] for dealing with this waste.




## FeSO<sub>4</sub>

>[!caution]
>FeSO<sub>4</sub> is a skin and eye irritant. Wear gloves and goggles when handling. 


>[!Warning]
>Iron (II) Sulfate is mildly toxic and an environmental hazard. Do not pour down the drain. Follow [[Waste Management#- FeSO<sub>4</sub>|Waste Management > FeSO4]] for dealing with this waste.
