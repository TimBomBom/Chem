# - FeSO<sub>4</sub>

Iron sulfate should not be poured down the drain as it is mildly toxic and is an environmental hazard ([SDS](https://www.fishersci.ca/shop/msdsproxy?productName=I1463&productDescription=ferrous-sulfate-heptahydrate-crystalline-certified-acs-fisher-chemical-3)). 
### Disposal Procedures:
1. Neutralize with NaOH to yield Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and Fe(OH)<sub>2(s)</sub> which can be oxidized to Fe(OH)<sub>3(s)</sub> 
2. Fe(OH)<sub>3(s)</sub> is safe to dispose of in common solid waste.

# - CuSO<sub>4</sub>

Solutions of CuSO<sub>4</sub> should not be poured down the drain as it is toxic and is an environmental hazard ([SDS](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/CA/en/sds/aldrich/451657?userType=undefined)).

### Disposal Procedures:
* #####  Method 1: Crystallization
	1. Boil down volume of CuSO<sub>4</sub> containing solution
	2. Crystallize into a solid
	3. Dispose of solid crystals in garbage (or store for future experiments)
* ##### Method 2: Displacement with Iron
	1. Place iron (nails or some other source) in CuSO<sub>4</sub> containing solution
	2. Collect solid copper and decant iron sulfate solution
	3. Follow [[Waste Management#- FeSO<sub>4</sub>|steps for FeSO4 disposal]] above
* ##### Method 3: Displacement with Al
	1. Like method 2, place aluminum foil in CuSO<sub>4</sub> containing solution
	2. Collect solid copper and decant aluminum sulfate solution
	3. React solution with NaOH to form solid aluminum hydroxide
	4. Dispose of solid hydroxide in a tightly sealed container in the garbage
